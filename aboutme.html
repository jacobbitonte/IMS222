          <p>I was first introduced to coding when I was 14. My brother built me a PC for my birthday and created a Codeacademy account. He said: 
      </aside>
    
        <blockquote>"Minecraft is written in JavaScript. You should start with that. You can do a lot of cool things with it if you get good at it."</blockquote>
          
        I wasn't <i>super</i> interested at first. But it sparked enough of an interest that I signed up for an intro to computer science <br></br> course my first semester of my freshman year in high school.
      <br></br>
    It was nothing crazy, but we dipped our toes in 
    <ol> <li>HTML</li> 
      <li>CSS</li> 
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>And the <u>smallest</u> amount of Python
      </ol>
    Nothing close to this course. Just calculators and "Hello Worlds"
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
     </main>
        <h2>But then I discovered</h2>
        <h2>Minecraft Mods</h2>
    <br></br>
    <br></br>
    For anyone born before the year 2000, these probably sound ridiculous; but the idea of being my favorite superheroes (Avengers had just released) was too good to be true. I could do that with <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/superheroes-unlimited/comments" target="_blank"> this mod. </a>
    <br></br>
    The only issue: I had to reconfigure the core coding of Minecraft's JS to prevent errors between the native and modded code - oftentimes there would be variables declared twice. 
    <br></br>
    Not only that, but occasionally developers (in this case, developer: this single guy created a huge mod and ran it himself) would release updates but forget to code in objects and values. <br></br>He would realize it upon booting it up, but instead of fixing it for the whole version, would just add an editors note on how he thinks it needs to be fixed. 
    <br></br> 
    If I was lucky, there would be a comment or video online showing where to go in the code to fix it. If not, it was a lot of trial and error messing around in the files.
